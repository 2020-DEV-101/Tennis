# Tennis

This coding kata is part of the selection process for Android Developer.
I did not create a full Android apk as that seems to be beyond the scope of this kata and requires a device or emulator to run.
Since this exercise is used in a job application some comments are placed to clarify my intention. 
In production code this would be replaced by conversations with team members.
For simplicity reasons everything will be committed on the master branch for this kata. 
When working in a team on a commercial application the team should decide on which git flow to use 
and should be used by all contributors of that repository.
Some explanations can be found in commit messages.
I added maven to easily add dependencies.
Of course any other build tool, such as gradle, can be used instead.

## Run the application

Using IntelliJ you can open the `TennisUI.kt` file and click on the green arrow in the gutter next to the main function.
Or use a run configuration with main class `be.kata.tennis.TennisUIKt`

If IntelliJ or a similar IDE is not available the application can be run by following the steps described in https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html

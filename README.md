This coding kata is part of the selection process for Android Developer.
I did not create a full Android apk as that seems to be beyond the scope of this kata and requires a device or emulator to run.
Since this exercise is used in a job application some comments are placed to clarify my intention. In production code this would be replaced by conversations with team members.
For simplicity reasons everything will be committed on the master branch for this kata. When working in a team on a commercial application the team should decide on which git flow to use and should be used by all contributors of that repository.

## TODO: how to compile and run
